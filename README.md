### Windows

For windows users, a `run_app.bat` has been added, which will create your virtual environment for you.

To use in terminal üë®‚Äçüíª

- `cd CEN4010` Go inside project folder
- `python3 -m venv venv` Create your virtual environment
- `source ./venv/bin/activate/` Activate your virtual environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` Install dependencies
- `cd app` Go inside app folder
- `uvicorn main:app --reload` Run uvicorn server

When uvicorn is online, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` on your browser to use SwaggerUI.

**_Note: Known ISSUES_**

If you are experiencing issues with the `run_app` not loading correctly, you might not have configured your Database locally.
By Default, the DB Config is set to

![](https://i.ibb.co/qRWQDW6/code1.png)

If the setting is `True` will automatically use the Heroku DB.

**_PLEASE USE YOUR LOCAL DB FOR TESTING!_**

## Documentation

Here you will find briefly what the folder structure is for our project.

### App folder

In the app folder, you will find all the components needed for our restful API self-explanatory.

### Config folder

In our config folder, you will find all the settings needed for our restful API, such as

**FASTAPI SETTINGS**

- `PROJECT_TITLE: str = 'Bookstore RestAPI'` Our restfulAPI title for FASTAPI
- `PROJECT_VERSION: str = '0.1.0'` Our version of our API

**DB SETTINGS**

**_CHANGE IF YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD YOU ARE DOING_**

- `POSTGRES_LOCAL: bool = True` `True` if you want to use local, `False` for Heroku
- `POSTGRES_USER: str` Postgres user most likely your machine name, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: str` If you set a local password, put it here, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_SERVER: str` Server you created locally, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_PORT: str = '5432'` Default port dont change
- `POSTGRES_DB: str` Database you created locally, Heroku is set already

### DB folder

In our DB folder, you will find our **database.py** and **models.py**

Do not touch **database.py** (skipping)

### Router folder

In our Routers folder, you will find all the routers created that get added to the API.

Create a `my_router.py` file 

In your router file, you need to create a router using.

`router = APIRouter()`

Instead of using `@app` decorator like in your `main.py` , you will use `@router`

ex:

`@router.get()`

**schemas.py**

Here you will introduce a new schema that is going to be used to validate data that is sent or shown
in the API

If you need to recreate another model for the Database, copy the `User` model already created and 
modify it to your needs. For extra help use [sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/tutorial.html#create-a-schema) docs

**utils.py**

Here will be utility functions to use throughout our app
currently, we have 

- `hash()` Hashes plain text passwords using bcrypt
- `verify()` Compares plain text passwords and hashed passwords stored in DB

**main.py**

The brains of our restful backend API here will add your API endpoints.

To add your API

import your router

ex: 

`from routers import my_router.py`

and inside our `start_app()` include your router to the `app` object

ex:

`app.inclue_router(my_router.router)`
